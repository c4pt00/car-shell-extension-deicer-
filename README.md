# car-shell-extension-deicer-
extension to melt underside as opposed to exterior car shell


a space heater panel fitted with strong fans (facing downward) on the underside around 105F with 4 direction fans pointing downward about 8-12" diameter the size of car subs 


can melt snow and ice underneath the car when a vehicle gets stuck in snow and ice when there are freezing conditions by pressing a button on the dashboard 


obviously this prototype should not catch a gas station on fire by pushing torrents of hot air downwards underneath the vehicle as a form of testing to make sure the underside of the vehicle is UL vehicle manufacturers

meet safety levels through testing this new underside device in a testing zone of the RD lab
